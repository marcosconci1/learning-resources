# Backtracking

Backtracking explores decisions recursively while undoing choices when constraints are violated, enabling exhaustive yet efficient search.

## Problems

| Combination Sum II | Medium | Backtracking, Sorting |
| Permutations | Medium | Backtracking, DFS |
| Subsets II | Medium | Backtracking, Sorting |
| Generate Parentheses | Medium | Backtracking, DFS |
| Word Search | Medium | Backtracking, DFS |
| Palindrome Partitioning | Medium | Backtracking, DFS |
| Letter Combinations of a Phone Number | Medium | Backtracking, DFS |
| N Queens | Hard | Backtracking, Recursion |

## Prerequisites

### Tree Maze (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Model branching decisions as a graph/tree to practice systematic backtracking in constrained spaces.

### Subsets (Advanced Algorithms)

Techniques for enumerating the power set recursively or with bitmasks while skipping duplicates.

### Combinations (Advanced Algorithms)

Generate combinations in lexicographic order using backtracking and pruning rules.

### Permutations (Advanced Algorithms)

Arrange elements in every possible order using swapping, DFS, or next-permutation algorithms.

## Common Patterns

### Decision Trees

Recurse over candidate choices and prune when constraints fail.

### State Tracking

Use arrays/sets to track used numbers, columns, or diagonals for O(1) checks.
