# Intervals

Interval problems revolve around sorting ranges, merging overlaps, and scheduling events without conflicts.

## Problems

| Problem | Difficulty | Topics |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Insert Interval | Medium | Intervals, Merge |
| Merge Intervals | Medium | Intervals, Sorting |
| Non Overlapping Intervals | Medium | Intervals, Greedy |
| Meeting Rooms | Easy | Intervals, Scheduling |
| Meeting Rooms II | Medium | Intervals, Sweep Line |
| Minimum Interval to Include Each Query | Hard | Intervals, Heap |

## Prerequisites

## Common Patterns

### Sort + Sweep

Sort by start (or end) times and sweep once to detect overlaps.

### Greedy Selection

Pick intervals based on earliest finishing time to maximize compatibility.
