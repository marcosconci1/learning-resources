# Heap / Priority Queue

Heaps let you retrieve extreme values in logarithmic time, powering scheduling, streaming, and graph algorithms.

## Problems

| Problem | Difficulty | Topics |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Kth Largest Element In a Stream | Easy | Heap, Design |
| Last Stone Weight | Easy | Heap, Simulation |
| K Closest Points to Origin | Medium | Heap, Geometry |
| Kth Largest Element In An Array | Medium | Heap, Array |
| Task Scheduler | Medium | Heap, Greedy |
| Design Twitter | Medium | Heap, Design |
| Find Median From Data Stream | Hard | Heap, Two Heaps |

## Prerequisites

### Heap Properties (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Understand how parent-child relationships enforce min/max ordering within a binary heap.

### Push and Pop (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Practice heappush/heappop operations and how they affect the heap array representation.

### Heapify (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Transform an array into a valid heap in O(n) and repair violations after updates.

### Two Heaps (Advanced Algorithms)

Maintain min and max heaps simultaneously to rebalance windows or track medians.

## Common Patterns

### Top-k Tracking

Use heaps to keep only the most relevant k elements while streaming data.

### Dual Heaps

Maintain a min-heap and max-heap to support sliding medians or balancing tasks.
