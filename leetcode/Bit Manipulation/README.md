## Prerequisites

### Bit Operations (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Manipulate bits with AND/OR/XOR, shifts, and masks to encode states compactly.

## Common Patterns

### Masking

Use bitmasks to isolate or toggle specific bits efficiently.

### XOR Tricks

Exploit XOR's cancellation property to detect unique elements or missing numbers.
