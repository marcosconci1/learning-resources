# Stack

Stack-based problems manage nested state or monotonic properties with a LIFO data structure. Proper stack usage keeps algorithms iterative and efficient.

## Problems

| Problem | Difficulty | Topics |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Valid Parentheses | Easy | Stack, String |
| Min Stack | Medium | Stack, Design |
| Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation | Medium | Stack, Math |
| Daily Temperatures | Medium | Stack, Monotonic |
| Car Fleet | Medium | Stack, Sorting |
| Largest Rectangle In Histogram | Hard | Stack, Monotonic |

## Prerequisites

### Stacks

LIFO structures that let you push values and pop them in reverse order to model nested state.

### Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners

Core course modules that cover asymptotic analysis, data-structure tradeoffs, and the ability to reason about complexity and constraints.

## Common Patterns

### Bracket Matching

Push opening symbols and pop when encountering a matching closing symbol to validate nested structures.

### Monotonic Stack

Maintain monotonic order in a stack to track the next greater/smaller element as you scan once.
