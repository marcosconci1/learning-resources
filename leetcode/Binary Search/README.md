# Binary Search

Binary search cuts the search space in half each iteration, making it ideal for sorted arrays or monotonic decision problems.

## Problems

| Problem | Difficulty | Topics |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Binary Search | Easy | Binary Search, Array |
| Search a 2D Matrix | Medium | Binary Search, Matrix |
| Koko Eating Bananas | Medium | Binary Search, Search Space |
| Find Minimum In Rotated Sorted Array | Medium | Binary Search, Array |
| Search In Rotated Sorted Array | Medium | Binary Search, Array |
| Time Based Key Value Store | Medium | Binary Search, Design |
| Median of Two Sorted Arrays | Hard | Binary Search, Divide and Conquer |

## Prerequisites

### Search Array (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Review how to scan arrays linearly and reason about invariants while searching for a target value.

### Search Range (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Practice splitting search space into halves and handling boundary cases when locating the first or last valid index.

## Common Patterns

### Lower/Upper Bound

Return the first or last index satisfying a predicate by keeping bias during midpoint updates.

### Binary Search on Answer

When the answer space is monotonic, search on the value rather than an explicit index.
