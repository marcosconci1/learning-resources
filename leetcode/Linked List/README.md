# Linked List

Linked list questions require careful pointer manipulation to traverse, modify, and reorganize nodes without corrupting the structure.

## Problems

| Problem | Difficulty | Topics |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Reverse Linked List | Easy | Linked List, Iteration |
| Merge Two Sorted Lists | Easy | Linked List, Recursion |
| Linked List Cycle | Easy | Linked List, Fast & Slow Pointers |
| Reorder List | Medium | Linked List, Two Pointers |
| Remove Nth Node From End of List | Medium | Linked List, Two Pointers |
| Copy List With Random Pointer | Medium | Linked List, Hash Map |
| Add Two Numbers | Medium | Linked List, Math |
| Find The Duplicate Number | Medium | Linked List, Floyd Cycle |
| LRU Cache | Medium | Design, Linked List |
| Merge K Sorted Lists | Hard | Linked List, Heap |
| Reverse Nodes In K Group | Hard | Linked List, Recursion |

## Prerequisites

### Singly Linked Lists (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Understand pointer manipulation when traversing a list in one direction and how to update next pointers safely.

### Doubly Linked Lists (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Learn how prev/next pointers enable O(1) removals and insertions while keeping list integrity.

### Fast and Slow Pointers (Advanced Algorithms)

Use multiple pointers that move at different speeds to detect cycles and locate midpoints.

## Common Patterns

### Pointer Reversal

Iteratively reverse next pointers while tracking previous nodes.

### Fast/Slow Splitting

Use two pointers to split, detect cycles, or locate nodes relative to the end.
