## Prerequisites

### BST Insert and Remove (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Refresh how binary search trees maintain sorted order during updates and how balancing affects height.

### Depth-First Search (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Traverse structures recursively or with a stack to explore as far as possible before backtracking.

### Breadth-First Search (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Work level by level using a queue to find the shortest path or gather nodes grouped by depth.

### BST Sets and Maps (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Learn how ordered maps and sets maintain sorted traversal order and allow range queries.

### Iterative DFS (Advanced Algorithms)

Replace recursion with manual stacks to avoid call stack limits while keeping DFS behavior.

## Common Patterns

### DFS Traversals

Use preorder/inorder/postorder traversals to compute subtree properties.

### BFS Levels

Process nodes level-by-level for visibility or shortest path style questions.
