# Two Pointers

The two pointers technique solves array and string problems by moving two indices that either converge or advance at different speeds. It often turns quadratic scans into linear passes.

## Problems

| Problem | Difficulty | Topics |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Valid Palindrome | Easy | Two Pointers, String |
| Two Sum II Input Array Is Sorted | Medium | Two Pointers, Binary Search |
| 3Sum | Medium | Two Pointers, Sorting |
| Container With Most Water | Medium | Two Pointers, Greedy |
| Trapping Rain Water | Hard | Two Pointers, Dynamic Programming |

## Prerequisites

### Two Pointers

Maintain two indices that converge or run at different speeds to compare elements and reduce nested loops to O(n).

### Advanced Algorithms

General problem-solving patterns like binary search on answer, line sweep, and optimized data structures that go beyond beginner templates.

## Common Patterns

### Opposite Ends

Start pointers at both ends and move them inward based on comparisons to find optimal pairs or check symmetry.

### Fast and Slow

Advance one pointer faster than the other to detect conditions like convergence or to skip over segments efficiently.
