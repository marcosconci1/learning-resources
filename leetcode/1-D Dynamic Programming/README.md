## Prerequisites

### 1-Dimension DP (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Set up recurrence relations that only depend on previous states and roll arrays when possible.

### Palindromes (Advanced Algorithms)

Recognize symmetric string patterns and leverage expand-around-center or DP to test palindromes quickly.

## Common Patterns

### Rolling Arrays

Store only the last few states when transitions depend on limited history.

### State Definitions

Clearly define what dp[i] represents to derive valid recurrences.
