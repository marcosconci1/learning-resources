# Graphs

Graph problems model relationships as nodes and edges, relying on traversal strategies and disjoint-set structures.

## Prerequisites

### Intro to Graphs (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Represent graphs via adjacency lists/matrices and reason about directed vs. undirected edges.

### Matrix DFS (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Perform DFS on grid graphs while respecting bounds and visited state.

### Matrix BFS (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Level-order traversal on matrices to model spreading processes or minimum steps.

### Adjacency List (Data Structures & Algorithms for Beginners)

Use adjacency lists for sparse graphs with efficient iteration over neighbors.

## Common Patterns

### Traversals

Pick BFS or DFS depending on whether you need breadth-first distances or deep exploration.

### Union Find

Maintain connectivity and detect cycles or redundant edges efficiently.
