# Learning Resources

This repository provides organized reference material and implementations across core software development topics. It aims to offer clear explanations, practical code samples, and concise study resources for foundational and intermediate concepts.

## Projects

The projects are organized by difficulty level. Each project contains a template file (`project-template.md`) with the problem description, step-by-step TODO checklist and helpful tips to guide you through the implementation.

**Structure per project:**
- `project-template.md` - Problem description with guided TODOs
- `project-solution.py` - Complete implementation

## LeetCode

This section contains solutions and explanations for LeetCode problems, organized by topic and difficulty. Each problem includes a template file to help you practice problem-solving patterns before viewing the solution.
